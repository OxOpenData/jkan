title: Article 4 Designations in Oxford
organization: Oxford City Council
notes: >-
  An article 4 direction is made by the local planning authority. It restricts
  the scope of permitted development rights either in relation to a particular
  area or site, or a particular type of development anywhere in the authorityâ€™s
  area. Where an article 4 direction is in effect, a planning application may be
  required for development that would otherwise have been permitted development.
  Article 4 directions are used to control works that could threaten the
  character of an area of acknowledged importance, such as a conservation
  area.
