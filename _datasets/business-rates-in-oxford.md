title: Business Rates in Oxford
organization: Oxford City Council
notes: >-
  Information on Business Rates payable for properties in the Oxford
  administrative area. Some details have not been published; in particular,
  those instances where the relevant exemption under the Freedom of Information
  Act 2000 can be applied. The name of a Business Rates payer who is an
  individual is considered to be personal information.  Therefore, it is exempt
  from disclosure under Section 40 of the Freedom of Information Act. Empty
  property within the city and businesses in receipt of hardship relief are not
  identified in the data.  Information about Business Rates credits is not
  published on this page because the Council works on these credits on a weekly
  basis as part of its routine housekeeping process and as the amounts are
  constantly changing, any information provided will be immediately out-of-date,
  inaccurate and probably misleading.
